# Hey, I'm Osaro 👋🏾 👨‍💻

![osarocodes](https://i.imgur.com/hbvE3wy.png)

I'm a full stack developer focused on building purposeful web applications with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). I believe technology is a powerful tool to **uplift communities**, and I’m here to build things that matter.
